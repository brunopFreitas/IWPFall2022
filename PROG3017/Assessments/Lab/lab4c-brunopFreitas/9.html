        //Copy the Driver class you created in the previous step and paste it in this section.

        //Add a method to your class called 'addTrip' which adds a new trip entry to the 'tripsInKilometres'
        //array. So for example, if the driver makes a new trip of 50kms in length, you could add the value
        //50 to the array by calling the object's setter and adding that value.

        //Example: driver.addTrip(50)

        //Add a method in the Driver class which when called will return the total number of kilometres
        //that the driver has travelled. Call the method and display the result in the console.
