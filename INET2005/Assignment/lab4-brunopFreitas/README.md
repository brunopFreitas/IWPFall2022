## PHP OOP

#### Preliminary Steps

1. Ensure that both your MySQL database is running on your Virtual Machine.
2. Refer to the class recordings and any Powerpoint slides used in the lectures for reference.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Create a Shape Area Calculator that uses Inheritance
1.	Using inheritance create three classes in PHP derived from a common abstract **`Shape`** class: **`Circle`**, **`Rectangle`**, and **`Triangle`**. 
2.	The `Shape` parent class can store the shape **`name`** and should have an abstract function called **`CalculateArea`** that all derived classes must implement.
3.	Have each derived class construct itself with the appropriate parameters to calculate its area.
4.	Have each derived class implement the **`CalculateArea`** function in the correct way for that shape.
5.	Now build  an **`index.php`** web page on top of the classes that might look a bit like the following example (I used the fieldset and legend tags to make my form look better).

#### Step 2: Add an interface and implement it in your Shape Area Calculator

1.	Add an interface to your application called **`iResizable`** that has a **`Resize`** function that allows you to grow an object’s area by a defined percentage passed is as an argument (e.g. “200%”) or to shrink an object’s area by the defined percentage passed is as an argument (e.g. “50%”). .
2.	Implement the interface in the **`Circle`** object so that it will modify the area and the radius for the object correctly when resized.
3.	Add a textbox for the Percent to grow/shrink and buttons to perform both actions to your Form. 
4.	Have that button change the area/radius output for the **`Circle`** object appropriately.
5.	Do the same to implement it for the Triangle by only changing the height (keep the base the same as previously entered).
6.	Rectangles will be a Shape but will <b>not</b> be resizable.
